Heyo, I'm Lukas

GitHub suggested I create a short summary about my self so here we are :)

I like to learn and expiriment with programming languages so I created a GitHub account incase I need a portfolio of my projects.

I'm a self-learner and there's still much for me to explore, but I would say I know the essentials of C++, Python, HTML, CSS.

Right now I'm taking a Udemy Full-Stack Web Developer course.
